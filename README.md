# INF653 Midterm Project

This is a web application created for my midterm in back-end web development. Its a simple web application designed to manage and display an inventory of used vehicles for a fake client.

The application is built using PHP, following the MVC design pattern and styled using Bootstrap. The application uses a MySQL database to store the inventory data.

## Features
- Public Homepage: that displays a list of vehicles for customers to browse and provided with filters.
- Admin Backend: that allows the client to manage the inventory by adding, editing, and deleting vehicles.
- Both utilize a responsive design that supports various devices and screen sizes.
